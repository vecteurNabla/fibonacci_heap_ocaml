# Fibonacci Heaps for OCaml
## Includes circular doubly linked lists

An implementation of priority queues using Fibonacci heaps in OCaml,
and a module for circular doubly-linked lists, since they are needed
for Fibonacci heaps.

This was a fun personal project, there are certainly more efficient
ways to implement Fibonacci heaps.
